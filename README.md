# My-Calculator
 A responsive and adaptive calculator I made just because!




### 📌 My Calculator  

A simple yet functional calculator built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It supports basic arithmetic operations along with logarithms, exponentiation, and constants like *π* and *e*.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **Basic arithmetic** (+, -, ×, ÷)  
✅ **Exponentiation** (^ for power calculations)  
✅ **Logarithmic operations** (log, ln)  
✅ **Constants** (π, e)  
✅ **Parentheses support** for complex expressions  
✅ **Clear & delete functions**  

## 🎨 UI Design  
The calculator has a **modern and colorful** design, with:  
🎨 **Soft color tones** for buttons & background  
🖌 **Round buttons** for an aesthetic look  
🌟 **Shadows & borders** for a 3D effect  

## 🛠 How to Use  
1️⃣ Click on the **number buttons** to input values.  
2️⃣ Use **operators (+, -, *, /, ^)** to build expressions.  
3️⃣ Press **"="** to evaluate the expression.  
4️⃣ Use **"CE"** to clear everything and **"←"** to delete the last entry.  

## 🔧 Technologies Used  
- **HTML** → Structure of the calculator  
- **CSS** → Styling and layout  
- **JavaScript** → Logic for handling calculations  

## 📂 File Structure  
```
📂 CalculatorProject  
 ├── 📄 index.html  (Main structure)  
 ├── 🎨 styles.css  (Styling rules)  
 ├── ⚙️ Functions.js (JS logic for calculations)  
```

## 📜 Code Explanation  
### 🔹 `Functions.js`  
- **Handles button clicks** dynamically using event listeners.  
- **Parses and formats** the input before evaluation.  
- **Supports π & e** by replacing them with their numerical values.  
- **Manages parentheses** by auto-correcting missing ones.  

## 🎯 Future Improvements  
🔹 Add a **history feature** to track calculations.  
🔹 Implement **scientific functions** like sin, cos, tan.  
🔹 Improve **mobile responsiveness** for better usability.
